= Week 4 - Why Our Expectations are so Bad =
DATE: FRI 06/26/2020

Homework:	Strategies that you can use intentionally to overcome your biases
	Set of Strategies #1 - Getting over getting used to stuff (Hedonic Adaptation)
		- Don't invest in stuff in the first place, instead invest in experiences
			- We don't adapt to experiences, experiences can make us happier than stuff
			- Experiences are better than stuff for other reasons too
		- Savoring - The act of stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it
			- Activities that enhance of savoring:
				- I talked to another person about how good I felt
				- I looked for other people to share it with
				- I thought about what a lucky person I am
				- I thought about sharing this later with others
				- I showed physical expressions of energy
				- I laughed or giggled
				- I told myself how proud I was
				- I thought only about the present, was absorbed
			- Activities that hurt savoring:
				- I focused on the future, when it was over
				- I reminded myself it would be over soon
				- I told myself it wasn't as good as I hoped
				- I reminded myself that nothing lasts forever
				- I thought how it would never be this good again
				- I thought about ways it could better
				- I told myself I didn't deserve this good thing
		- Negative Visualization
