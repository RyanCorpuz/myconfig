		Learning state of the art and implement these algorithms.
		Make sure to do the exercise

		Machine Learning
			- Grew out of work in AI
			- New capability for computers
		
			Examples:
				- Database mining
					Large datasets from growth of automation/web.
					E.g., Web click data, medical records, biology, engineering
				- Applications can't program by hand.
					E.g., Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, most of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision
				- Self-customizing programs
					E.g., Amazon, Netflix product recommendations
				- Understanding human learning (brain, real AI)
		
		What is Machine Learning?
			- Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
			- Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E
			
			Example: playing checkers
				E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
				T = the task of playing checkers
				P = The probability that the program will win the next game

			Q: Supposed your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam. What is the task T in this setting?
				x	Classifying emails as spam or not spam ***CORRECT*** *T
				o	Watching you label emails as spam or not spam *E
				o	The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam *P
				o	None of the above- this is not a machine learning problem.
			
			Machine learning Algorithms:
				- Supervised learning
				- Unsupervised learning

				Others: Reinforcement learning, recommender systems

			Also talk about: Practical advice for applying learning algorithms
		
		Supervised Learning
			"Right answers" given
			
			Regression Problem:
				Predict continuous valued output(price)

			Classification Problem:
				Discrete valued output

			Q: You're running a company, and you want to develop learning algorithms to address each of two problems. Problem 1: You have a large inventory of identical items. You want to predict how many if these items will sell over the next 3 months. Problem 2: You'd like software to examine individual customer accounts, and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised. Should you treat these as classification or as regression problems?
					o	Treat both as classification problems.
					o	Treat problem 1 as a classification problem problem 2 as a regression problem
					x	Treat problem 1 as a regression problem, problem 2 as a classification problem ***CORRECT***
					o	Treat both as regression problems

		Unsupervised Learning
			-or- Clustering
			Application Examples:
				- Organize computing clusters
				- Social network analysis
				- Market segmentation
				- Astronomical data analysis

			Cocktail Party Problem

			Q: Of the following examples, which would you address using an unsupervised learning algorithm?
				o	Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter.
				x	Give a set of news articles found on the web. group them into sets of articles about the same stories.
				x	Given a database of customer data, automaticalled discover market segments and group customers into different market segments.
				o	Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not.
				**CORRECT**

	LINEAR ALGEBRA REVIEW
	DATE: FRI 05/01/2020

		Only add matrices of the same dimensions resulting a matrix with same dimension	

		m x n matrix X m x o matrix = m x o matrix

		"Commutative"	->	A x B = B x A
		Matrix multiplication is NOT commutative 	*Exception: If B is Identity matrix I

		"Associative"	-> A x (B x C) = (A x B) x C
		Matrix multiplication IS associative
