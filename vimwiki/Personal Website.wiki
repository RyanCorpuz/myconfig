Time to do a redo of the person website

== The Goal ==

The goal is to create a platform where I can show myself and my abilities off. This includes faceshot, list of skills, projects and links to projects (link github to it), contact information. All that jazz.

== Technologies ==

The goal here is to use Vue.js for frontend and golang for backend. And implement with heroku.
