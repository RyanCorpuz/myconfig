Method 1: Increase heartrate up to a point to stretch heart increasing stroke and volume rate.

Method 2: Interval training. Heartrate up to 80%-90% then switch to walking (very demanding and too easy to create problems if used prematurely)

Do an exercise that is dynamic in nature, raise heartrate to 80%-90% (where you can still answer a question) and then walk around (120-130 bpm (which is 65%)). THIS IS JUST FOR THE HEART

Need to focus on mitochondria in the muscle cell. 

Way to develop mitochondria (make muscle enduring)

The conditions for mithochondria to handle more traffic is to push it to the edge. What we do:

Imagine that you are sprinting (5-7sec) then walking, then sprinting, then walking.... get to the point of just light muscular fatigue.

Repeat training is waiting long enough to do the exact same thing.
