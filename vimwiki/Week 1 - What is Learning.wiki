FOCUSED VERSUS DIFFUSE THINKING
DATE: TUE 04/28/2020

	Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes	
		Q: Check the statements that fit best to the diffused (as opposed to the focused) mode of thinking:
			x	Using a different analogy from the video, the diffused mode could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in any one area. (As opposed to the focused mode, which would have its light cast very strongly in a single area, but very weakly everywhere else.)
			x	The type of thinking you need to do when you are trying to understand something new.
			o	The type of intense concentration you need to work through a problem, step-by-step
			o	A pinball machine that has bumpers which are very tightly grouped together, so thhe pinball (the thouught) can't go very far without bumping into a bumper
			o	As the video specifically mentioned, this is the type of thinking that aardvarks are best at
			***CORRECT***
	
	Using the Focused and Diffused Modes
		When you are learning something new, your mind needs to go back between the two different thinking modes
		
		Summary
			- Metaphors provide powerful technigques for learning
			- Focueed and diffusde modes
			- Learning something difficult takes time
	
	What is Learning
		New synapses form over 24H and good sleep.

		Q: According to the video, what happens on the dendrites of neurons when you learn something new? (Select the single best answer.)
			x	Many new synapses (connections) are formed on the dendrites
			o	The dendrites develope a sort of putty substance that conducts electricity through blood.
			o	As Dr. Sejnowski discussed in detail, the dendrites wilt
			***CORRECT***
		Q: How many synapses are there in the brain?
			x	a million billion
			o	a million
			o	a billion
			o	twenty thousand
			***CORRECT***

PROCRASTINATION, MEMORY, AND SLEEP
DATE: THU 06/11/2020

	A Procrastination Preview
		Gist - Use pomodoro
	
	Practice Makes Permanent
		Keep working to develop more permanent neural pathways for problem solving
	
	Introduction to Memory
		Working memory - part of memory that has to do with what you are immediately processing in your mind
		Long Term memory - need to revisit something being committed before it is stored in Long Term memory
		Use a technique called spaced repetition over a number of days	
		"Spaced repetition" is good because it builds stronger neural structures by repeating them over a number of days
	
	The Importance of Sleep in Learning
		We know this
		If you go over what you are learning right before sleep, increases chances of dreaming it, and if you want it, dreaming enhances ability to understand.
		Allows the brain to wash away metabolic toxins
		Allows your brain to strengthen important parts of memories even as it erases less important memories
		Allows your brain a chance to rehearse difficult material - going over and over the tougher aspects of what you are trying to learn
		Makes a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems an to understand what you are trying to learn
	
	Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski
		- Learn more with active engagement opposed to passive learning (ask a question to enhance learning)
		- Exercise (Recess between learning with physical exercise)
		- Discussing ideas with others boosts the creative process and science
		- Success is does not come by just being smart, is from passion and persistence *****
	
SUMMARY
- If stuck, sit back and take more time (diffuse mode)
- Everything takes time, don't procrastinate
- Practise and repetition important for more abstract topics
- Working memory can hold only 4 chunks, if you practise it enough it will get into long term memory (may need review to keep it there)
- Don't repeat in one day but over a few days
- Exercise improves memory and ability to learn
