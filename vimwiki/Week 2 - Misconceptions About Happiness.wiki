		Savoring 
			- The act of stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it
			- Intensifies and lengthens the positive emotions that come with doing something you love
			- Example experiences. nice shower, delicious meal, walk outside, or any experience that you really enjoy
			- Common techniques that enhance savoring:
				- Sharing the experience with another person
				- Thinking about how lucky you are to enjoy such an amazing moment
				- Keeping a souvenir or photo of that activity
				- making sure you stay in the present moment the entire time
			- Make a note of what you savored (make a list)
			- When you record it at the end of the day, take a moment to remember the activity
